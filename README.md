# Air-Quality-and-Weather-Data-Analysis-at-IIT-Kanpur

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a Tableau dashboard for visualizing air quality and weather data at IIT Kanpur, covering the period from 2021 to 2024. The goal is to provide insights into environmental parameters and their correlations, aiding in data-driven decision-making for environmental monitoring.

## Objective

- Develop an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize air quality and weather data.
- Analyze key environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, AQI (Air Quality Index), and particulate matter (PM 1.0, PM 2.5, PM 4.0, PM 10.0).
- Provide insights into the relationship between air quality and weather patterns.

## Features

- Interactive visualizations with filters to explore data by time period and environmental parameters.
- Comprehensive analysis of environmental parameters over the specified period.
- Correlation analysis to understand the relationship between air quality and weather conditions.

## Technologies Used

- **Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **CSV Data Processing**: For handling and preprocessing environmental data.
- **Environmental Data Analysis**: For analyzing and interpreting data trends and correlations.

## Data

- The dataset includes environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, AQI, and particulate matter (PM 1.0, PM 2.5, PM 4.0, PM 10.0).
- Data covers the period from 2021 to 2024.

## Files Included

Here is a summary of the files and directories included in this repository:

- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
- **Database_airq_IIT-KANPUR (1).twbx**: The Tableau workbook file containing the dashboard and visualizations.
- **CSV_zipped**: A directory containing raw data files (.csv) of all the parameters mentioned.
- **LICENSE**: The license information for the project.

## Getting Started

To view the Tableau dashboard and interact with the visualizations, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git

2. **Open the Tableau File**:
   - Use Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public to open the `.twbx` file located in the repository.

3. **Explore Interactive Visualizations**:
   - Analyze the data by interacting with the visualizations and filters available in the Tableau dashboard.

4. **Upload Additional Data**:
   - You can upload CSV files provided in the Tableau Project or download the latest data from [Fog Prediction Data](https://fog.iitk.ac.in/fog-prediction/).
   - Use this data to create your own visualizations, perform additional analysis, derive correlations, and integrate them into the dashboard.

## Usage

- **Adjust Filters**
  - Use the provided filters to modify the time period and environmental parameters.

- **Analyze Data**
  - Investigate trends and correlations between air quality and weather conditions.
